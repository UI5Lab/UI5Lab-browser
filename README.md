# What is it
UI5Lab is a community driven repository for UI5 Custom Control Libraries. It's purpose is to make it easy for everyone to share, retrieve and use UI5 Custom Controls. Contributions welcome!

# UI5Lab-browser
This repository contains a browser to display custom libraries and control examples on the UI5Lab homepage. The app implemented in UI5 can also be used for testing control samples and previewing libraries during development. Have a look at our [documentation](http://ui5lab.io/docs/) for more details. 

#### Setup

Run the following commands to test or develop this project:

1. Install node.js (get it from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/))

> **Note:** If working behind a proxy, you need to configure it properly (HTTP_PROXY / HTTPS_PROXY / NO_PROXY environment variables)

2. Clone the repository and navigate into it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UI5Lab/UI5Lab-browser
cd UI5Lab-browser
```

3. Install all npm dependencies :

```sh
npm install
```

4. Run a local Web server with the ui5 tools for testing:

```sh
npm start
```

> **Note:** Run ```npm install --global @ui5/cli``` if the ```ui5``` command is not registered (for more information see [ui5 tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling]))

5. Open the browser with the following URL: [http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html)

> **Note:** To test the browser, one or more libraries should be defined as a dependency and registered in the libraries.json file. See the ```gh-pages``` branch of UI5Lab-central project for a live example

#### Publishing to npm

The library project and the central project reference the browser via npm module. In order to publish a new version to npm follow these steps:

1. Maintain the package.json file and increase the version number


2. Run the ui5 build tools to create a library preload and the CSS theme build for your library artifacts. Everything (minified and unminified sources) will be created in the ```dist``` folder, ready to be published and consumed by other projects

```sh
npm run build
```

3. Publish your package to npm, be sure to include only the metadata and the dist folder to keep the package size small (see .npmignore file for details) 

```sh
npm publish
```

> **Note:**  Official UI5Lab packages have to be published with the user ```ui5lab```, if you do not have permission ask a member the UI5Lab core team
